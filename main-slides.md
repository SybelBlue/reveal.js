#### *A Quick Detour: The Superiority Model*
### Things You Definitely Shouldn't Do

**do not ridicule...**
- your students, assistants, or colleagues
- learning speeds/styles/preferences/differences
- any marginalized *(or identifiable)* community

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

#### *A Quick Detour: The Superiority Model*
### Things You Definitely Shouldn't Do

**do not ridicule...**

yourself!

*(mostly\*)*

*more on this later

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

offensive humor (including ridicule) <br>
forms the basis of inappropriate humor

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

#### *An Even Quicker Detour: The Arousal Model*
### Things You Definitely Shouldn't Do

**do not put jokes on exams**

(though it did decrease exam anxiety for high anxiety students)
<!-- .element: class="citation" -->

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

from here on out, we'll be running with <br> incongruity theory and appropriate humor

### Theories of Humor
**Instructional Humor Processing Theory**

[Wanzer et al. - 2010]
<!-- .element: class="citation" -->

draws on *elaboration likelihood model* of persuasion

elaboration: internalization and processing

high elaboration = high likelihood of attitude shift

[Allport - 1935, Ross - 1908]
<!-- .element: class="citation" -->

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Theories of Humor
**Instructional Humor Processing Theory**

generally good for predictions:
- content-related humor correlated with learning
- disparaging/offensive humor **didn't** correlate

--- <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Quantitative Work on Humor
**Frequency**

attempt frequency is all over the place

varies by uni, culture, country, experience...

most profs don't use humor at all (< 2 attempts/hr)

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Quantitative Work on Humor
**Frequency**

award-winning lecturers warn against frequent use <br>
(avg 7.5 attempts/hr)

experienced faculty use humor more than GSIs <br>
(avg 6.5 vs 1.5 attempts/hr)

4 attempts/hr seems optimal <br>
*(but again, your mileage __will__ vary)*

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Quantitative Work on Humor
**Student-Generated Data**

for appropriate, intentional humor:
- related/unrelated humor are equally common
- self-disparaging humor is rare (~10%)

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Quantitative Work on Humor
**Frequency by Type**

among yarns, riddles, puns, sidebar and gags, <br>
yarns are the most common

--- <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Personal Effects of Humor
**by Speaker's Gender**

- men can use tendentious humor, <br> women shouldn't*
- women use content-related humor, <br> men don't*
- men make more attempts at humor

*\*from students reports in dated/small-n studies*

Note: tendentious: promote a controversial opinion

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Personal Effects of Humor
**on Personal Perception**

- makes faculty more approachable outside class
- immediacy's effect on reception is unclear*
- leaning into humor orientation is usually positive

*all of these are subject to cultural variation*

Note: immediacy - engendering closeness

*inappropriate humor from immediate teachers is significantly worse

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Personal Effects of Humor
**on Credibility**

credibility comes from:
- expertise
- trustworthiness
- goodwill

[Teven and McCrosky - 1997]
<!-- .element: class="citation" -->

Note: literally studied since Aristotle
- authoritativeness, composure, competency
- sincerity
- "know your audience" and what they want

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Personal Effects of Humor
**on Credibility**

humor alone ups trustworthiness, goodwill, <br>
& composure, but doesn't increase competency

*usually, humor increases credibility*...<br>
...but overuse can decrease perceived goodwill

(inappropriate humor is bad for everything)

### Humor and Learning

*all of this is hotly contested in literature!*

claims in this section draw on lit. consensus

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Humor and Learning
**Attention**

humor is good at gaining/keeping attention

*this meshes with IHPT's predictions*

Note: "substantial empirical support"

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Humor and Learning
**Retention**

numerous studies* find no change, <br> a few showed negative correlation

*\*many discredited for study design issues*
<!-- .element: class="citation" -->

beware propensity to "eat the onion"

students might only remember the joke, <br> not the related content

Note: many studies were criticized for study design issues (retention time-frame, what kinds of humor, small n)

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Humor and Learning
**Retention**

some show positive correlation, particularly:
- when curriculum-relevant humor is used
- when humor is employed during lecture
- when retention checked after 2 months

1. humor should illustrate/highlight a concept
2. paraphrase concept after the joke
3. leverage the memorability with a callback
