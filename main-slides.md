### Theories of Humor

**superiority model**

**arousal model**

**incongruity model**

**instructional humor processing theory**

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Theories of Humor

**superiority model**

*humor as competitive play (see monkeys)*

**arousal model**

*humor as subconscious/emotional processing*

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

***Lessons from the Superiority Model***

most useful today to define inappropriate humor

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

***Lessons from the Superiority Model***
#### Things You Definitely Shouldn't Do

- mock any class member(s)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- ridicule learners or learning
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- joke about any nameable community
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
- your students, assistants, co-teachers, colleagues
- learning speeds/styles/preferences/differences
- any marginalized *(or identifiable)* community

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

***Lessons from the Superiority Model***
#### Things You Definitely Shouldn't Do

avoid mocking yourself! <span class="fragment">*(mostly\*)*</span>

*students were divided on appropriateness, <br>
but it may damage credibility regardless
<!-- .element: class="citation fragment" -->

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

***Lessons from the Superiority Model***

offensive humor (including ridicule) <br>
forms the basis of inappropriate humor

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

***Lessons from the Arousal Model***

*humor as emotional/subconscious process*

**avoid putting jokes on exams**
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

(though it did decrease exam anxiety for high anxiety students)
<!-- .element: class="citation fragment" -->

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

***Lessons from the Arousal Model***

humor eases in-the-moment emotional processing

it can be used to protect oneself or, <br>
to release tension following shock/surprise

*be careful, it can also backfire*

### Theories of Humor

*superiority model*

*arousal model*

**incongruity model**

**instructional humor processing theory**

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Theories of Humor

**instructional humor processing theory**

*humor as invitation to elaborate*

[Wanzer et al. - 2010]
<!-- .element: class="citation" -->

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Theories of Humor

**instructional humor processing theory**

draws on *elaboration likelihood model* of persuasion

elaboration: internalization and processing

high elaboration = high likelihood of attitude shift

[Allport - 1935, Ross - 1908]

### Theories of Humor
**Instructional Humor Processing Theory**

generally good for predictions:
- content-related humor correlated with learning
- disparaging/offensive humor **didn't** correlate

--- <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Theories of Humor

*superiority model*

*arousal model*

**incongruity model**

*instructional humor processing theory*

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Theories of Humor

**incongruity model**

*humor as cognitive mismatch*

content-related humor came out <br>
the clear winner for planned humor

IHPT backs this up

Note: surprising contradiction invites elaboration

### Personal Aspects of Humor
#### A Brief Detour on *You*

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

#### A Brief Detour on *You*

as a *person*, you may be:
- more/less humor-oriented
- more/less witty/sardonic
- more/less personable

*all of these can change with time and effort!*

[bell hooks]
<!-- .element: class="citation" -->

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

#### A Brief Detour on *You*

as an **instructor**, you may be:
- more/less immediate
- more/less technical
- more/less warm

*all of these can change with time and effort!*

*your style of humor should reflect <br> your classroom persona*

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Personal Aspects of Humor
**Personal Perception**

- leaning into humor orientation is usually positive
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- makes faculty more approachable outside class
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- immediacy's effect on reception is unclear*
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

*all of these are subject to cultural variation*
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: immediacy - engendering closeness

*inappropriate humor from immediate teachers is significantly worse

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Personal Aspects of Humor
**on Credibility**

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Personal Aspects of Humor
**on Credibility**

credibility comes from:
- expertise
- trustworthiness
- goodwill

[Teven and McCrosky - 1997]
<!-- .element: class="citation" -->

Note: literally studied since Aristotle
- authoritativeness, composure, competency
- sincerity
- "know your audience" and what they want

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Personal Aspects of Humor
**on Credibility**

humor alone ups trustworthiness, goodwill, <br>
& composure, but doesn't increase competency

*usually, humor increases credibility*...<br>
...but overuse can decrease perceived goodwill

(inappropriate humor is bad for everything)

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Personal Aspects of Humor
**(Dated) Gender Observations**

- men can use tendentious humor, <br> women shouldn't
- men make more attempts at humor, <br> be careful of overuse

*from students' reports in dated/small-n studies*

Note: tendentious: promote a controversial opinion

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Personal Aspects of Humor
**(Dated) Gender Observations**

according to students, <br>
women used higher proportions of:
- content-related humor
- social stratifying humor

statistically significant findings, but <br> *we may be showing our biases here*

### Humor and Learning

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Humor and Learning

*all of this is hotly contested in literature!*

unsubstantiated claims in this section <br>
imply strong consensus in literature

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Humor and Learning
**Retention**

on the one hand, <br>
numerous studies* find no change <br>
and a few showed negative correlation

*\*many discredited for study design issues*

Note: criticized for study design issues (retention time-frame, what kinds of humor, small n)

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Humor and Learning
**Retention**

on the other hand, <br>
some show positive correlation, particularly:
- when curriculum-relevant humor is used
- when humor is employed during lecture
- when retention checked after 2 months


+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Humor and Learning
**Attention**

humor is good at gaining/keeping attention

*this meshes with IHPT's predictions*

Note: "substantial empirical support"

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Humor and Learning
**Warnings on Learning Outcomes**

beware the propensity to "eat the onion"

students may only remember the joke, <br> not the related content

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Humor and Learning
**Main Learning Takeaway**

*humor can thought of like a verbal highlighter*

b/c students may only remember the joke, <br>
*be sure to repeat the content (if any) after*

don't highlight ironically; <br>
choose your target intentionally

*quantitative data, anyone?*

### Quantitative Work on Humor

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Quantitative Work on Humor
**Frequency**

attempt frequency is all over the place

varies by uni, culture, country, experience...

some profs don't use humor at all (< 2 attempts/hr)

Note: sometimes upwards of 40% don't use, others less than 20%

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Quantitative Work on Humor
**Frequency**

award-winning lecturers warn against frequent use <br>
(avg 7.5 attempts/hr)

experienced faculty use humor more than GSIs <br>
(avg 6.5 vs 1.5 attempts/hr)

4 attempts/hr seems optimal <br>
*(but again, your mileage __will__ vary)*

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Quantitative Work on Humor
**Student-Generated Data**

for appropriate, intentional humor:
- related/unrelated humor are equally common
- self-disparaging humor is rare (~10%)

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Quantitative Work on Humor
**Frequency by Type**

among yarns, riddles, puns, sidebar and gags, <br>
yarns are the most common
