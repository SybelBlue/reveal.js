## Warning: A Work-in-Progress

Info from a 1st-of-its-Kind work studying how CS
- Legitimizes

- Masks

- Gives a Place of Refuge

## Warning: A Work-in-Progress

"Neurodiversity" is categorized on axes including:

- Special Interest
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
- Attention
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
- Organization
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->

*\*And many more in the paper!*

### Study Population

- ~20 students, faculty, industry workers
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
- A Mix of Self-Identified and Establishment-Diagnosed
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
- Some publicly identified, others individually disclosed

### Part One

<hr>

## Analysis Along Axes

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

## Analysis Along Axes

### Special Interests

- Vocational computing legitimized CS hobbies
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
- CS interest is used as a baseline for comparison
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
- CS hobbies were expected to be exclusive
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

## Analysis Along Axes

### Attention

- Hyperfocus is legitimized and given refuge
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
- Sometimes hyperfocus reported "essential"
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
- Some hyperfocus to medically dangerous extents
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->

Note: extremes tend to come from compensation.

Not all bad news though

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

## Analysis Along Axes

### Organization

-
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
*Proper-Styled™️* code reported "necessary in SE"
- Sometimes hyperfocus is seen as "essential"
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
- Industry can sometimes accommodate cyclical attention patterns
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->

Note: disadvantage to non-conformist/hypo-focusing individuals

### Part Two

## Analysis Beyond Axes

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

## Analysis Beyond Axes

Professionals in industry report:

> "[My workplace] looks like a bunch of neurodivergent people just designed this without knowing what they were doing."
<!-- .element: class="wide" -->

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

## Analysis Beyond Axes

Professionals in industry report:

- Ready access to free food and facilities
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
- Short meetings with non-confrontational tone
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
- High-degree of day-to-day flexibility
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->

Note: viewed as normalized, inherent, universal accommodation

## Analysis Beyond Axes

#### A Singular Voice

One trans, non-binary, autistic individual's voice was especially platformed in the paper.

They believe that CS is an artistic practice supportive of their intersectional identity.

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

## Analysis Beyond Axes

#### A Singular Voice

> "As a creative endeavor, [computing] is autistic in a way that other creative endeavors aren’t...<br> I go to creative coding [spaces], I’m like, Y’all are great. I love you. I love this for you. <br> But I need to not be here."
<!-- .element: class="wide" -->

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

## Analysis Beyond Axes

#### A Singular Voice

> "Because all y’all are resonating on a different wavelength. And, like, this is actually not for me, and like, I understand that you feel gate-kept from my basement, and I’m very sorry for that. But I feel gate-kept from here. But I’m not going to tell you about that."

## Paradoxes of CS Spaces

Kirdani-Ryan and Ko conclude with a few remarks:
> CS can provide <br> a unique, legitimizing space
<!-- .element: class="good" -->
> CS certainly replicates hegemonic oppression and repression
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in bad" -->

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

## Paradoxes of CS Spaces

Kirdani-Ryan and Ko conclude with a few remarks:

> Women are encouraged into STEM
<!-- .element: class="good" -->
> They are stifled, ignored, degraded, and quickly flee
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in bad" -->

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

## Paradoxes of CS Spaces

Kirdani-Ryan and Ko conclude with a few remarks:

> Working environs are sometimes worker-friendly
<!-- .element: class="good" -->
> Industry often produces damaging goods or services
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in bad" -->

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

## Paradoxes of CS Spaces

> There is much work to do yet.

## Conclusion

Computing spaces can legitimize and accommodate neurodivergence.
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->

Some neurodiverse behaviors are cast as "necessary for success."
<!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->

*This is just the start for understanding this problem.*
