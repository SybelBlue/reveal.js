### abstractions

### abstraction blindness

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### abstractions

> The Way™️ of representing <br> some
> structure or behavior <br> in a particular context

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### abstractions

good abstractions...
- are derived from context
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- meaningfully limit what is possible
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- play nicely with other abstractions
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

### abstractions
#### an example: steering controls

- pac-man steering
- car steering
- tank steering

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### abstraction blindness

you floor the gas, the car goes...

...regardless of the brick wall in front of you

*every abstraction has blind-spots*

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### abstraction blindness

a good thinker tracks their abstraction blindness

a responsible thinker looks for blindness to harm

> learning lots of representations
> can reveal your blind-spots

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### abstraction blindness

*powerful, when used well*

- study your context continually
- understand the abstraction's limits
- when in doubt, talk to a human
