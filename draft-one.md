### Things You Definitely Shouldn't Do
#### *Lessons from the Superiority Model*

**never ridicule...**
- any class member(s)
- learners or learning
- any nameable community

Note:
- your students, assistants, co-teachers, colleagues
- learning speeds/styles/preferences/differences
- any marginalized *(or identifiable)* community

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Things You Definitely Shouldn't Do
#### *Lessons from the Superiority Model*

**usually best not to ridicule...**

yourself! <span class="fragment">*(mostly\*)*</span>

### Things You Definitely Shouldn't Do

offensive humor (including ridicule) <br>
forms the basis of inappropriate humor

### Things You Definitely Shouldn't Do
#### *Lessons from the Arousal Model*

**do not put jokes on exams**

(though it did decrease exam anxiety for high anxiety students)

### Things You Definitely Shouldn't Do
#### *Lessons from the Arousal Model*

in patient/doctor settings, <br>
tension-relieving humor had inconclusive value

from here on out, we'll be running with <br> incongruity theory and appropriate humor

### Theories of Humor
**Instructional Humor Processing Theory**

[Wanzer et al. - 2010]
<!-- .element: class="citation" -->

draws on *elaboration likelihood model* of persuasion
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

elaboration: internalization and processing
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

high elaboration = high likelihood of attitude shift
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

[Allport - 1935, Ross - 1908]
<!-- .element: class="citation" -->

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Theories of Humor
**Instructional Humor Processing Theory**

generally good for predictions:
- content-related humor correlated with learning
- disparaging/offensive humor **didn't** correlate

### Quantitative Work on Humor

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Quantitative Work on Humor
**Frequency**

attempt frequency is all over the place

varies by uni, culture, country, experience...

some profs don't use humor at all (< 2 attempts/hr)

Note: sometimes upwards of 40% don't use, others less than 20%

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Quantitative Work on Humor
**Frequency**

award-winning lecturers warn against frequent use <br>
(avg 7.5 attempts/hr)

experienced faculty use humor more than GSIs <br>
(avg 6.5 vs 1.5 attempts/hr)

4 attempts/hr seems optimal <br>
*(but again, your mileage __will__ vary)*

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Quantitative Work on Humor
**Student-Generated Data**

for appropriate, intentional humor:
- related/unrelated humor are equally common
- self-disparaging humor is rare (~10%)

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Quantitative Work on Humor
**Frequency by Type**

among yarns, riddles, puns, sidebar and gags, <br>
yarns are the most common

### Personal Effects of Humor

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Personal Effects of Humor
**by Speaker's Gender**

- men can use tendentious humor, <br> women shouldn't*
- women use content-related humor, <br> men don't*
- men make more attempts at humor

*\*from students reports in dated/small-n studies*

Note: tendentious: promote a controversial opinion

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Personal Effects of Humor
**on Personal Perception**

- makes faculty more approachable outside class
- immediacy's effect on reception is unclear*
- leaning into humor orientation is usually positive

*all of these are subject to cultural variation*

Note: immediacy - engendering closeness

*inappropriate humor from immediate teachers is significantly worse

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Personal Effects of Humor
**on Credibility**

credibility comes from:
- expertise
- trustworthiness
- goodwill

[Teven and McCrosky - 1997]
<!-- .element: class="citation" -->

Note: literally studied since Aristotle
- authoritativeness, composure, competency
- sincerity
- "know your audience" and what they want

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Personal Effects of Humor
**on Credibility**

humor alone ups trustworthiness, goodwill, <br>
& composure, but doesn't increase competency

*usually, humor increases credibility*...<br>
...but overuse can decrease perceived goodwill

(inappropriate humor is bad for everything)

### Humor and Learning

*all of this is hotly contested in literature!*

claims in this section draw on lit. consensus

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Humor and Learning
**Attention**

humor is good at gaining/keeping attention

*this meshes with IHPT's predictions*

Note: "substantial empirical support"

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Humor and Learning
**Retention**

numerous studies* find no change, <br> a few showed negative correlation

*\*many discredited for study design issues*
<!-- .element: class="citation" -->

beware propensity to "eat the onion"

students might only remember the joke, <br> not the related content

Note: many studies were criticized for study design issues (retention time-frame, what kinds of humor, small n)

+++ <!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->

### Humor and Learning
**Retention**

some show positive correlation, particularly:
- when curriculum-relevant humor is used
- when humor is employed during lecture
- when retention checked after 2 months
