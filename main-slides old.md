Sounds Great!

<i><small>How do I use it...</small></i>

You'll need:

- A Prompt
- Your Solution
- The Spec (a Test Suite)

*These can be all in one file!*

### Students *must* learn to write tests.

- Instructors provide Applications
- Students write Test Suites.

Note: Ideally test suites find bugs.

Gatekeepers for New Curricula:
- How do we scaffold it?
- How do we grade it?
- *A secret third thing?*

*So how do we scaffold test-writing?*

> Problem Sequences

> Faded Parsons Problems


Note:
- Scaffolding is hard.
- Scaffolding reduces cognitive load.
- Scaffold by imposing Guiding Structure.

+++

*So how do we grade test-writing?*

We need to evaluate students' test suites.

*Spec-Based* Autograders won't work here.

+++

*So how do we grade test-writing?*

> Mutation-Based Autograding

This is a known technique.

*Remember: Students write a test suite*
